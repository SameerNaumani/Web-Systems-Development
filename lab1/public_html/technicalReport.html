  <h1>Technical Report - Sameer Naumani - 500703778</h1>

  <h2>Question 1</h2>
  <a href="htmlcode.txt">This is the Code for Main Page</a>

  <h2>Question 2</h2>
  <p>To password protect the page, I used javascript to check if the user entered the word that I had set which was <em>password</em>. If they successfully put it in the Javascript alert box they were granted access.</p>

  <h2>Question 3</h2>
  <p> I am new to HTML so most of the tags I tried were new. In particular, one of the new tags I tried was the img tag. I used this tag to put a picture of the Toronto Maple Leafs logo and resized it.</p>

  <h2>Question 4</h2>
  <p>No, my page does not look different in different browsers.</p>

  <h2>Question 5</h2>
  <p>I spent approximately 4 hours on this lab.</p>
